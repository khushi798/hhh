vector space:


In mathematics, a vector space is a collection of objects, called vectors, which can be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, 
called scalars, such that certain axioms are satisfied. The scalars are typically taken to be real numbers or complex numbers,
although they could also be taken from other fields.

The axioms that must be satisfied for a collection of objects to be a vector space are:

Closure under vector addition: If u and v are vectors in the space, then u + v is also a vector in the space.
Associativity of vector addition: For all vectors u, v, and w in the space, (u + v) + w = u + (v + w).
Commutativity of vector addition: For all vectors u and v in the space, u + v = v + u.
Existence of a zero vector: There exists a vector 0 in the space such that for any vector u in the space, u + 0 = u.
Existence of additive inverses: For every vector u in the space, there exists a vector -u in the space such that u + (-u) = 0.
Closure under scalar multiplication: For any scalar c and any vector u in the space, the product cu is also a vector in the space.
Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition: For any scalar c and any vectors u and v in the space, c(u + v) = cu + cv.
Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition: For any scalars c and d and any vector u in the space, (c + d)u = cu + du.
Associativity of scalar multiplication: For any scalars c and d and any vector u in the space, (cd)u = c(du) = cdu.
Identity element of scalar multiplication: For any vector u in the space, 1u = u, where 1 is the multiplicative identity of the scalar field.

SUBSPACE:


In linear algebra, a subspace is a subset of a vector space that satisfies the following properties:

It contains the zero vector.
It is closed under vector addition.
It is closed under scalar multiplication.
More formally, let V be a vector space over a field F,
and let W be a non-empty subset of V. Then W is a subspace of V if and only if the following conditions hold:

The zero vector, denoted by 0, is in W.
If u and v are in W, then their sum u + v is in W.
If c is in F and u is in W, then the scalar multiple cu is in W.
Note that these conditions imply that W is itself a vector space over F, with the same operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication as V.

Examples of subspaces include the set of all vectors in R^3 whose third coordinate is zero, the set of all solutions to a homogeneous system of linear equations,
and the set of all polynomials of degree at most n, where n is a fixed non-negative integer.

Subspaces are important in linear algebra because they provide a way of breaking down a larger vector space into smaller, more manageable parts.
They also have many applications in geometry, physics, and other areas of mathematics.

LINEAR COMBINATION:
In linear algebra, a linear combination is a sum of scalar multiples of vectors. More specifically, given a vector space V over a field F,
and a finite set of vectors {v1, v2, ..., vn} in V, a linear combination of these vectors is an expression of the form

c1v1 + c2v2 + ... + cnvn

where c1, c2, ..., cn are scalars from F.

The scalars c1, c2, ..., cn are called the coefficients of the linear combination. Note that a linear combination may involve
just one vector (in which case there is only one nonzero coefficient), or it may involve many vectors.

Examples of linear combinations include:

In R^3, the vector (3, 2, 1) is a linear combination of the vectors (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1), with coefficients 3, 2, and 1, respectively.
In the vector space of polynomials with coefficients in R, the polynomial 2x^2 + 3x - 1 is a linear combination of the polynomials x^2, x, and 1,
with coefficients 2, 3, and -1, respectively.
Linear combinations are important in linear algebra because they provide a way of generating new vectors from existing ones.
For example, a subspace of a vector space is a set of vectors that can be expressed as linear combinations of a given set of vectors.
Linear combinations also play a key role in the study of linear independence, basis, and span of a set of vectors.

LINEAR SPAN:


In linear algebra, the linear span of a set of vectors {v1, v2, ..., vn} in a vector space V is the set of all linear combinations of those vectors.

More formally, the linear span of {v1, v2, ..., vn} is the set of all vectors of the form

c1v1 + c2v2 + ... + cnvn

where c1, c2, ..., cn are scalars from the underlying field of the vector space.

The linear span of a set of vectors is a subspace of the vector space containing those vectors. 
Moreover, any subspace containing the given set of vectors must also contain their linear span.

The linear span of a set of vectors is denoted by the symbol Span{v1, v2, ..., vn}.

Examples of linear spans include:

In R^2, the linear span of the vectors (1, 0) and (0, 1) is the entire plane, since any vector in R^2 can be expressed as a linear combination of these two vectors.
In the vector space of polynomials with coefficients in R, the linear span of the polynomials x^2, x, and 1 is the set of all polynomials of degree at most 2,
since any such polynomial can be expressed as a linear combination of these three polynomials.
The concept of linear span is important in linear algebra because it provides a way of characterizing the set of all vectors that can be generated from a given 
set of vectors. Linear spans also play a key role in the study of linear independence, basis, and dimension of a vector space.

Convex Sets:


In mathematics, a convex set is a subset of a vector space such that any point on the line segment connecting any two points in the set is also in the set.
In other words, a convex set is a set where for any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them lies entirely within the set.

More formally, let V be a vector space and let S be a subset of V. Then S is a convex set if, for any two points x and y in S and any scalar t between 0 and 1, 
the point tx + (1-t)y is also in S. This is equivalent to saying that, if x and y are in S, then the line segment connecting x and y is also in S.

Examples of convex sets include:

Any closed ball (including the boundary) in R^n is a convex set. That is, for any two points in the ball, the line segment connecting them lies entirely 
within the ball.
The set of all positive semidefinite matrices is a convex set in the vector space of n x n matrices.
The set of all probability distributions on a finite set is a convex set in the vector space of real-valued functions on that set.
Convex sets are important in many areas of mathematics, including optimization, geometry, and functional analysis. 
They have nice geometric and algebraic properties that make them easier to work with than more general sets, 
and they are widely used in modeling and solving real-world problems.


 Linear Independence/Dependence:
 
 
 In linear algebra, a set of vectors {v1, v2, ..., vn} in a vector space V is said to be linearly independent if no vector in the set 
 can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set. Equivalently, the only solution to the equation

c1v1 + c2v2 + ... + cnvn = 0

(where c1, c2, ..., cn are scalars from the underlying field of the vector space) is the trivial solution c1 = c2 = ... = cn = 0.

If a set of vectors is not linearly independent, then it is said to be linearly dependent. In this case, at least one vector in the set 
can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set. More precisely, there exist scalars c1, c2, ..., cn, not all zero, such that

c1v1 + c2v2 + ... + cnvn = 0.

In other words, the vector equation has a nontrivial solution.

Examples of linearly independent and dependent sets of vectors include:

The set {(1, 0), (0, 1)} is linearly independent in R^2, since no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vector. 
On the other hand, the set {(1, 2), (3, 4)} is linearly dependent in R^2, since the second vector can be expressed as
a linear combination of the first vector: (3, 4) = 2(1, 2) + (-1)(3, 4).
The set {1, x, x^2} is linearly independent in the vector space of polynomials with coefficients in R, since no polynomial in the set 
can be expressed as a linear combination of the other polynomials. On the other hand, the set {1, 1 + x, 1 + 2x + x^2} is linearly dependent 
in the same vector space, since the third polynomial can be expressed as a linear combination of the first two polynomials: 1 + 2x + x^2 = (1 + x) + x(1 + x).
Linear independence and dependence are important concepts in linear algebra because they provide a way of characterizing the structure of sets of vectors. 
In particular, linearly independent sets play a key role in the definition of basis and dimension of a vector space, while linearly dependent sets 
can be used to generate new vectors as linear combinations of existing ones.


Basis & Dimension:


In linear algebra, a basis for a vector space V is a set of linearly independent vectors that span V. 
In other words, a basis is a set of vectors that can be used to express any vector in V as a linear combination. More formally,
let V be a vector space and let {v1, v2, ..., vn} be a set of vectors in V. Then {v1, v2, ..., vn} is a basis for V if and only if:

{v1, v2, ..., vn} is linearly independent, i.e., no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set.
{v1, v2, ..., vn} spans V, i.e., every vector in V can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in the set.
The dimension of a vector space V is the number of vectors in any basis for V. The dimension is always a non-negative integer or infinity. 
If V has a finite basis, then V is said to be finite-dimensional, and its dimension is the number of vectors in any finite basis.
If V does not have a finite basis, then V is said to be infinite-dimensional.

Examples of bases and dimensions include:



The standard basis for R^n is the set of n standard basis vectors, where the ith vector has a 1 in the ith coordinate and 0 in all other coordinates. 
This basis has n vectors and therefore R^n is n-dimensional.
The set {1, x, x^2} is a basis for the vector space of polynomials of degree at most 2 with coefficients in R. This basis has 3 vectors and
therefore the vector space is 3-dimensional.
The set of all continuous functions on the interval [0, 1] is an infinite-dimensional vector space with no finite basis.
Bases and dimensions are important concepts in linear algebra because they provide a way of characterizing the structure of vector spaces. 
They are used in many applications, including solving systems of linear equations, diagonalizing matrices, and analyzing the behavior of linear transformations.

Linear transformation on finite dimensional vector spaces:


A linear transformation T between two finite-dimensional vector spaces V and W is a function that preserves the vector space structure.
More specifically, T is a linear transformation if it satisfies the following properties:

T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) for all u, v in V (additivity)
T(cu) = cT(u) for all u in V and scalar c (homogeneity)
T(0) = 0, where 0 denotes the zero vector in V.
Given a basis {v1, v2, ..., vn} for V, any vector u in V can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors:

u = a1v1 + a2v2 + ... + anvn

The linear transformation T can then be uniquely defined by specifying its action on the basis vectors, 
since the value of T(u) is determined by the values of T(v1), T(v2), ..., T(vn). More specifically, if we define the images of the basis vectors as:

T(v1), T(v2), ..., T(vn)

then the action of T on any vector u in V can be computed as:

T(u) = a1T(v1) + a2T(v2) + ... + anT(vn)

This property makes it convenient to study linear transformations on finite-dimensional vector spaces by examining their action on a basis.

The matrix representation of a linear transformation is a way of representing a linear transformation T as a matrix A, such that T(u) = Au for all vectors u in V.
The columns of the matrix A are the images of the basis vectors under T.
The matrix representation of a linear transformation allows us to perform calculations and analyze properties of the transformation using matrix algebra techniques.

Linear transformations on finite-dimensional vector spaces play an important role in many areas of mathematics, science, and engineering, including linear algebra
, geometry, physics, and computer graphics. They are used to model a wide range of phenomena, including physical systems, signal processing, and data analysis.


Inner Product Space:


In mathematics, an inner product space is a vector space V equipped with an inner product, which is a function that takes two vectors in V and returns a scalar.
The inner product is denoted by ⟨u, v⟩ and satisfies the following properties for all vectors u, v, and w in V, and scalars a and b:

⟨u, v⟩ = ⟨v, u⟩ (symmetry)
⟨a u + b v, w⟩ = a ⟨u, w⟩ + b ⟨v, w⟩ (linearity in the first argument)
⟨u, u⟩ ≥ 0, and ⟨u, u⟩ = 0 if and only if u = 0 (positive-definiteness)
The inner product generalizes the dot product in Euclidean space, and provides a way of measuring the angle between two vectors and the length of a vector.
The norm of a vector u in an inner product space is defined as the square root of the inner product of u with itself:

||u|| = sqrt(⟨u, u⟩)

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any vectors u and v in an inner product space, we have:

|⟨u, v⟩| ≤ ||u|| ||v||

Equality holds if and only if u and v are linearly dependent.

A basis for an inner product space can be orthonormalized using the Gram-Schmidt process, which produces a new set of basis vectors that are orthogonal
to each other and have unit norm. The orthonormal basis can be used to represent any vector in the inner product space as a linear combination of the
basis vectors, and the coefficients in the linear combination can be computed using the inner product.

Examples of inner product spaces include Euclidean spaces, complex Hilbert spaces, and function spaces with suitable inner products, such as L^2 spaces.
Inner product spaces are used in many areas of mathematics, physics, and engineering, including functional analysis, quantum mechanics, signal processing, 
and data analysis.



Orthonormal Basis:


An orthonormal basis is a set of vectors in an inner product space that are pairwise orthogonal and have unit norm. More formally,
a set of vectors {v1, v2, ..., vn} in an inner product space V is said to be an orthonormal basis if:

⟨vi, vj⟩ = 0 for i ≠ j (orthogonality)
⟨vi, vi⟩ = 1 for all i (unit norm)
The set {v1, v2, ..., vn} spans V.
The orthonormality condition implies that the angle between any two distinct vectors in the basis is 90 degrees,
and the unit norm condition ensures that each vector has a length of 1.

Every finite-dimensional inner product space has an orthonormal basis, which can be obtained by applying the Gram-Schmidt process to any given basis. 
The Gram-Schmidt process is an algorithm that takes a linearly independent set of vectors and produces an orthonormal set that spans the same subspace.
The orthonormalization is achieved by subtracting the projection of each vector onto the span of the preceding vectors in the sequence, 
and then normalizing the resulting vector to have unit length.

Orthonormal bases have many useful properties, such as simplifying computations involving inner products, providing a natural coordinate system for 
vectors in the space, and enabling efficient diagonalization of certain matrices. For example, if {v1, v2, ..., vn} is an orthonormal basis for an 
inner product space V, then any vector u in V can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors as:

u = ⟨u, v1⟩v1 + ⟨u, v2⟩v2 + ... + ⟨u, vn⟩vn

The coefficients ⟨u, v1⟩, ⟨u, v2⟩, ..., ⟨u, vn⟩ are called the coordinates of u with respect to the orthonormal basis {v1, v2, ..., vn}, and can 
be computed using the inner product.

Orthonormal bases are also important in spectral theory, where they are used to diagonalize Hermitian and normal operators on Hilbert spaces,
 and in quantum mechanics, where they provide a natural basis for describing the states of quantum systems.
 
 
  Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization Process:
  
  
  The Gram-Schmidt process is an algorithm that takes a linearly independent set of vectors and produces an orthonormal set that spans the same subspace. 
  The process works as follows:

Suppose we have a set of linearly independent vectors {v1, v2, ..., vn} in an inner product space V.

Set w1 = v1.

For i = 2, 3, ..., n, define wi as follows:

a. Compute the projection of vi onto the subspace spanned by w1, w2, ..., wi-1:

proj(wi) = ⟨vi, w1⟩w1 + ⟨vi, w2⟩w2 + ... + ⟨vi, wi-1⟩wi-1

b. Subtract the projection from vi to obtain a vector that is orthogonal to w1, w2, ..., wi-1:

wi = vi - proj(wi)

c. Normalize the resulting vector to have unit length:

wi = wi / ||wi||

At the end of this process, we obtain an orthonormal basis {w1, w2, ..., wn} that spans the same subspace as the original set of vectors {v1, v2, ..., vn}.

The projection of vi onto the subspace spanned by w1, w2, ..., wi-1 is given by the formula:

proj(wi) = (⟨vi, w1⟩/⟨w1, w1⟩)w1 + (⟨vi, w2⟩/⟨w2, w2⟩)w2 + ... + (⟨vi, wi-1⟩/⟨wi-1, wi-1⟩)wi-1

This formula uses the inner product to compute the coefficients of the linear combination of the basis vectors that forms the projection. '
The subtraction of the projection from vi eliminates the component of vi that lies in the subspace spanned by w1, w2, ..., wi-1, and the normalization
ensures that the resulting vector has unit length.

The Gram-Schmidt process is widely used in linear algebra and its applications, including least squares approximation, numerical analysis, signal processing, 
and machine learning. It is an important tool for constructing orthonormal bases, which have many useful properties and applications.
